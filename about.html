					Within her scientific career, Misha searches for meaning in the microscopic world, 
					from researching the growth patterns in developing organisms to calculating p-values.  
					Through her watercolor and large scale art, she harmonizes with the greater world.  
					She is the co-founder of a community-based arts incubator in West Oakland called Majorelle 
					Arts, which teaches local artists creative skills like welding, metal fabrication and patina work.
