				<h1>Bio</h1>
				<p>
					Within her scientific career, <b>Misha</b> searches for meaning in the microscopic world, 
					from researching the growth patterns in developing organisms to calculating p-values.  
					Through her watercolor and large scale art, she harmonizes with the greater world.  
					She is the co-founder of a community-based arts incubator in West Oakland called Majorelle 
					Arts, which teaches local artists creative skills like welding, metal fabrication and patina work.  
				</p>
				<p><b>Majorelle Arts</b> is an arts incubator based in American Steel studios, of West Oakland.  We believe in the continuing education of our community through the creation of large scale art.  These pieces immerse the audience in a mythic reimagining of the natural world.  These living wonders invite viewers through the looking glass, to participate and touch. </p>
